Spatial Designing for Climate Adaptation
St. Johns Waterfront, Portland (OR), USA

This project explores climate-adaptive urban design strategies for the St. Johns Waterfront district in Portland, Oregon.
It integrates urban planning, hydrological modeling (SWMM), landscape design, climate analysis, and sustainable mixed-use development approaches.

Project Overview

The design focuses on transforming a 2.81-acre CM3-zoned site into a pedestrian-oriented, climate-resilient urban district.
Key goals include:

Increasing density while maintaining environmental resilience

Integrating LID (Low Impact Development) stormwater strategies

Improving urban microclimate conditions through design interventions

Creating a vibrant, mixed-use, community-oriented environment

Methods & Tools

Hydrological modeling: SWMM – infiltration, runoff, storage simulation

Urban climate analysis: sun path, wind rose, psychrometric chart

Design tools: Rhino/Grasshopper, Ladybug Tools, QGIS

Mapping & visualization: GIS spatial analysis + architectural layout design

Hydrological Modeling (SWMM)

Two scenarios were simulated:

Pre-development natural condition

Post-development with integrated LID measures

Results showed significant reductions in:

Peak runoff

Total runoff volume

Impervious runoff coefficient

#LID Strategies Applied

Permeable pavements

Bioswales

Bioretention areas

Stormwater storage ponds

Green roofs

These measures improved infiltration capacity and increased overall water retention.

Urban & Architectural Design

Mixed-use block configuration (A–B–C blocks)

Ground-floor commercial + upper-floor residential

Solar optimization + shading strategies

Enhanced pedestrian spaces and public realm

Energy-adaptive community layout

📊 Climate Analysis

Using Ladybug Tools, the project analyzed:

Monthly rainfall

Monthly temperatures

Wind rose patterns

Psychrometric comfort analysis

Passive/active design strategies

Insights informed layout, orientation, and façade design.
